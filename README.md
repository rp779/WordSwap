Our application is straightforward, upon opening the project1.exe, press the play button to be directed towards the next scene of the application. In the future, it is possible to add more difficult and longer sentences to work with the algorithm of the program, but for now, we chose a 35 word sentence, which is the first and only array button on the screen. Upon clicking that button and moving to the next scene, you will be prompted to begin making a sentence from the first 5 words you see. After every 5 words, you will be given 5 more, and can keep constructing your sentence to the best of your ability. The purpose of this application is to teach younger students and children how to think scientifically, and that it is possible to get different results with the exact same data.
